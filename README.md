<h1 align="center">Opencpop -CJKE Multidict-</h1>
**Opencpop -CJKE Multidict-** is a quadrilingual, multi-dictionary [Diffsinger](https://github.com/openvpi/diffsinger) model trained on the Opencpop dataset (as well as several others used for parallel training; see below).
"CJKE" stands for "Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English". I use the pronunciation "cake" (using the second letter "A" in the word "Japanese" rather than the first letter "J").

Please refer to the [Terms of Use](ToU_EN.md) documents included with this release. The Terms of Use are multilingual, making use of machine translation for non-English languages. Apologies for any translation errors.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** This model is ***STRICTLY FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY***. If you still wish to use this model for commercial projects, you'll need to contact the Opencpop Team for permission; note that fees may apply.

## Model information
### Supported embeds
- Duration;
- Pitch;
- Random pitch shifting (gender);
- Velocity;
- Multi-dictionary;
### Supported languages
- Mandarin Chinese (primary);
- English;
- Japanese;
- Korean;
### Phonetic systems used:
- Chinese: opencpop-extended;
- English: ARPABET (basic phonemes only);
- Japanese: NNSVS-style;
- Korean: NNSVS-style;
### Additional phonemes
 - `EXH` (exhale sound);
- `cl` (various uses, such as glottal stop, gemination, etc.), akin to how it's used in Synthesizer V);
### Other features:
- This model makes use of the [PC-NSF-HiFiGAN vocoder](https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/tag/pc-nsf-hifigan-44.1k-hop512-128bin-2025.02), which has support for tone shift. This can be convenient in lieu of vocal modes and/or variance embeds.
- Trained on reflow, LYNXNet (acoustic), WaveNet (duration + pitch), RoPE.
- All dictionaries contain support for Japanese kana (both hiragana and katakana).
- The English dictionary has support for Korean Hangeul as well.
    - Please make sure to enter Korean lyrics phonetically rather than as-written when combining with English on the same track.
- The Japanese dictionary also contains support for romaji (Hepburn).
- The Korean dictionary also contains support for romaja (Revised Romanization).
### Additional notes
- The pitch model may not be perfect and may need multiple rendering attempts in order to get the desired result. However, it should be decently usable in most contexts.
